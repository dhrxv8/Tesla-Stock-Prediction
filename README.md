## Tesla Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook file named "Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction_.ipynb" that demonstrates how to predict the stock price of Tesla using linear regression. The notebook uses Python and imports necessary libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn.

### Usage

To use this notebook, you will need to have Jupyter installed on your machine. You can then download the "Tesla_Stock_Price_Prediction_.ipynb" file and open it in Jupyter. From there, you can run the code cells to see how the linear regression model is trained and used to predict the stock prices of Tesla.

### Data

The data used in this notebook is a CSV file containing the historical stock prices of Tesla. The data is split into training and testing sets, and the linear regression model is trained on the training set. The model is then used to predict the stock prices on the testing set, and the accuracy of the model is evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error.

### Dependencies

This notebook requires the following libraries to be installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

### Conclusion

This notebook provides a useful example of how to use linear regression to predict stock prices and can be a helpful resource for anyone interested in this topic. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact me.
